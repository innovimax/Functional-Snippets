This is a small library to demonstrate some functional programming ideas in Java for my blog. The first post
is at http://mikefroh.blogspot.com/2011/12/intro-to-functional-programming-with.html, and will eventually contain
a table of contents linking to the other blog posts on the subject.

For a real functional programming library in Java, check out http://functionaljava.org/.
